I've been trying to get a better and deeper understanding with regard to **window's boundaries** and **behavior** when it comes to *stateful stream processing* in [**Apache Flink**](https://flink.apache.org/). This led to a detailed and example-driven quest which did not leave me alone even during my sleep!

IMHO, one of the best ways to **really and deeply** understand a piece of functionality and verify that understanding, is writing **automated tests** for it. The reason being, traditional unit tests are extremely primitive and stupid; hence, you need to truly understand ins and outs of the target piece in order to properly lay out the ingredients of each test:

- Arrange
- Act
- Assert

Once you start writing such tests, you immediately realize that as usual, the devil is in the details and things can get a tad confusing. The purpose of this writing is to clarify some of those confusions and explain the relevant concepts in a more concrete and example-driven fashion.

In case you're interested, you can find the entire code in [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/Sam-Serpoosh/194068bd4e9fea9958bfae1cf618597b).

## Establishing Concepts, Terminology & Acronyms

Before getting into different scenarios and examples, let's establish some definitions and acronyms which will be used throughout this post.

Keep in mind that we'll be **entirely** dealing with **TimeCharacteristic.EventTime** in our execution environment here. This means that we're divorcing ourselves from **Processing Time** and everything is driven based on the **EVENT_TIME** of individual events arriving at the operator. For more information on **different kinds** of **times** you can be dealing with in a stream processing application, check out [this document](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/dev/event_time.html#event-time--processing-time--ingestion-time).

#### Terminology & Definitions

- [**Watermark**](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.html): This determines the *advancement* of the stream your **operator** is consuming. In other words, Flink uses this concept in order to understand how much progress your operator has made with regard to the `EVENT_TIME`.
  - Watermarks are **special records** which are **injected** into the incoming stream by the source or a [WatermarkAssigner](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/api/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/functions/AssignerWithPeriodicWatermarks.html). A **watermark** carries a **timestamp** which signals to the framework (Flink), that all records with **older (less than or equal)** event time have arrived at this point.
  - There are many good resources explaining this concept in more details. You can check out [this article](http://vishnuviswanath.com/flink_eventtime.html) and [this document](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#handling-late-data-and-watermarking) to start with.
- [**Time Window**](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/stream/operators/windows.html): This allows you to hold on to multiple events as they arrive for **some period of time** and apply some logic to them as a group (e.g. **sum** them up).
  - There are different kinds of windows in stream processing and you can read all about them in Apache Flink's [official documents](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/stream/operators/windows.html).
  - In this post, we're mainly focusing on [**Tumbling Windows**](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/stream/operators/windows.html#tumbling-windows).
- [**Max Out Of Orderness**](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/dev/event_timestamp_extractors.html#assigners-allowing-a-fixed-amount-of-lateness): This can represent the **characteristics** of the incoming  stream or an **assumption** about it. For instance, you might know that events belonging to this particular stream can be as late as **one minute** sometimes. This knowledge then, can be utilized in your **watermarking strategy**. In this case the watermark **lags behind** the *max-event-time-seen-so-far* by the *max-out-of-orderness* value (e.g. one minute).
- [**Allowed Lateness**](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/stream/operators/windows.html#allowed-lateness): This is quite self explanatory and also determines how long a **window's state** should be kept before **discarded**.

#### Acronyms & Symbols

Throughout this post I'm going to use some acronyms and symbols, so let's quickly define them and get them out of the way:

| Acronyms & Symbols | Meaning |
|:-:|:-:|
| CW | Current Watermark |
| EOW | End Of Window |
| MOO | Max Out of Orderness |
| AL | Allowed Lateness |
| [a, b) | Window: INCLUSIVE beg "a" & EXCLUSIVE end "b" |
| m | Minute (e.g. 2m means 2 minutes) |

## Current Watermark & The Behavior It Ensues

Imagine we have the **TumblingEventTimeWindow** of **[8:00, 8:05)** with size **5 minutes** (**EOW** would be **8:04:59:999**). Any **event** whose **timestamp** is in that range, belongs to this window and will be stored as such. Below you can find the role **CW** can play in a few important scenarios which we'll be dealing with in our examples later:

- **MOO = ZERO & NO AL**
  - CW = max-event-time-seen-so-far
  - When `CW >= EOW`
      - Window's result is fired/triggered
      - Events arriving after this point and belonging to this window are **late** and will be **discarded**
- **With MOO**
  - CW = max-event-time-seen-so-far - MOO
  - When `CW >= EOW`
      - Window's result is fired/triggered
      - Events arriving after this point and belonging to this window are **late** and will be **discarded**
- **WITH AL**
  - CW = max-event-time-seen-so-far
  - When `CW >= EOW`
      - Windowâ€™s result is fired/triggered
  - While `EOW < CW < EOW + AL`
      - Events arriving and belonging to **this window** result in the firing/emission of **updated** results for **the window**
  - When `CW >= EOW + AL`
      - The window is **discarded**
      - Events arriving after this point and belonging to this window are **late** and will be **discarded**

NOTE that you can also control (to some extent) the behavior of **firing results** via other levers such as [Triggers](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/stream/operators/windows.html#triggers); but that's out of the scope of this post.

## Our Toy Example

For the purposes of this post, let's say we have a simple `Item` which has the following properties:

- `ts`
  - This represents our [**EVENT_TIME**](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/event_time.html) timestamp throughout all the examples; as opposed to `Processing Time` which we do **not** care about here. This is the timestamp that our [TimestampExtractor](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.6/dev/event_timestamp_extractors.html) will work with.
- `city`
  - The original **city** from which the item was shipped.
- `price`

A quick guideline on the images in the following sections:

- Yellow box means a **late** event which **won't** be **discarded** and still allocated to the window it belongs to
- Events that are further to the right on the **x-axis** (indicating **processing time**), have arrived **later** than the ones on **their left**
- Red dot on the x-axis indicates the moment a window's result is **fired/emitted** OR a window is **discarded**
- Finally, an event is represented as a box containing the following information:

| Row | Content |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Event Time & The Window It Belongs To |
| 2 | CW Value |

### Case of Max Out Of Orderness & ZERO Allowed Lateness

Let's say we have the following simple **aggregation** logic in our *Operator*:

```java
final static Time WIN_SIZE = Time.minutes(5);

DataStream<Item> aggregateItem(DataStream<Item> items) {
  return items
    .assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(
      new WatermarkAssigner<>(MOO, Item::getTs)
    )
    .keyBy((KeySelector<Item, String>) Item::getCity)
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(WIN_SIZE))
    .aggregate(new ItemAggregator())
    .uid(AGG_ID);
}
```

- [ItemAggregator](https://gist.github.com/Sam-Serpoosh/194068bd4e9fea9958bfae1cf618597b#file-tumblingeventtimewindowtest-java-L419-L462) is an implementation of `AggregateFunction<Item, Item, Item>` which knows how to aggregate *Item* instances/events
- [WatermarkAssigner](https://gist.github.com/Sam-Serpoosh/194068bd4e9fea9958bfae1cf618597b#file-tumblingeventtimewindowtest-java-L464-L480) is an implementation of `BoundedOutOfOrdernessTimestampExtractor<Item>`
- **MOO** determines the value for **max out of orderness** and is tweaked in different scenarios we'll be dealing with

#### MOO Is ZERO

At **t3**:

- **CW** becomes **8:06**
- Which makes it **>=** EOW of **[8:00, 8:05)**
- Hence, the result for **[8:00, 8:05)** containing **TWO elements** is fired off

#### MOO Is TWO Minutes

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d66e7Za8bgfxnf3P9x6XYQzpg0JJlZBW/preview" width="755" height="129"></iframe>

At **t4**:

- **CW** becomes **8:06**
- Which makes it **>=** EOW of **[8:00, 8:05)**
- Hence, the result for **[8:00, 8:05)** containing **TWO elements** is fired off
- Key Differences:
  - In the **previous** scenario, the arrival of the event with timestamp **8:06** triggered the window's result since that made the **CW** to become **8:06** and **>= EOW** for **[8:00, 8:05)**
  - But in this scenario, due to **MOO** being **2m**, the value of **CW** gets shifted back **2 minutes**. Hence, the arrival of the event with timestmap **8:08** at **t4** advances the **CW** far enough (making it **8:06**) to trigger the result for our window.

### Case of Allowed Lateness & ZERO Max Out Of Orderness

Let's say we have the following simple **aggregation** logic in our *Operator*:

```java
final static Time WIN_SIZE = Time.minutes(5);
final static Time MOO      = Time.seconds(0);

DataStream<Item> aggregateItem(DataStream<Item> items) {
  return items
    .assignTimestampsAndWatermarks(
      new WatermarkAssigner<>(MOO, Item::getTs)
    )
    .keyBy((KeySelector<Item, String>) Item::getCity)
    .window(TumblingEventTimeWindows.of(WIN_SIZE))
    .allowedLateness(AL)
    .aggregate(new ItemAggregator())
    .uid(AGG_ID);
}
```

- **AL** determines the value for **Allowed Lateness** and is tweaked in different scenarios we'll be dealing with

#### AL Is TWO Minutes

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VGFezWXEK4dwQU-YquLQ3iQISgxjQTto/preview" width="743" height="126"></iframe>

At **t2**:

- **CW** becomes **8:06**
- Which makes it **>=** EOW of **[8:00, 8:05)**
- Hence, the result for **[8:00, 8:05)** containing **ONE element** is fired off
- BUT, since we have **AL = 2m**, the window will be **kept**

At **t3**:

- A **LATE** event belonging to **[8:00, 8:05)** window arrives
- This results in firing an **updated result** for **[8:00, 8:05)** which now contains **TWO elements**
- The **CW** is still **8:06** which is **<=** to **(EOW + AL)**
- Hence, the window will be **kept**

At **t4**:

- **CW** becomes **8:08** due to the arrival of the event with timestamp **8:08**
- Now, **CW** has become **>=** (**EOW + 2m**)
- Hence, the **[8:00, 8:05)** window is **discarded**
- And from this point forward, any event that belongs to this window is **too late** and will be **discarded**

I'm going to leave the next natural test/scenario which is having **both** AL & MOO with **non-zero** values as an exercise to whoever is interested (e.g. MOO = **2m** & AL = **1m**)!

## A Word On Windows Boundaries

The key curiosity that motivated this whole quest, which now I've shared with you in excruciating details; was **how does Flink choose** the **windows' boundaries**?!

### Tumbling Event Time Window

Originally, I was under the impression that the boundaries for this type of window are determined based on the **arriving events' event timestamp**. But as you start to think about this more carefully, you'd see that it can result in a quagmire. Let's look at an example for a window of **size 5 minutes**:

- Event with **8:27** timestamp arrives which would result in the window **[8:27, 8:32)**
- Event with **8:25** timestamp arrives and we'd have a few options here:
  - Open the window **[8:25, 8:30)**
      - This is **NOT** a tumbling window anymore due to the **overlap** with our previous window **[8:27, 8:32)** and results in a contradiction **=> <=**
  - Open the window **[8:25, 8:27)**
      - This has the **wrong size** which also violates the tumbling window's definition and results in contraction **=> <=**
  - And any window-opening logic which **looks back in time** can result in quite a complex logic in Flink's state and window management

Hence, **Apache Flink** divides the [arrow of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdTMuivYF30), **starting at Unix epoch** and based on the provided size of the **Tumbling Window**. And that's how we get boundaries like the following for the size **5 minutes**:
  
  - **[8:00, 8:05)**
  - **[8:45, 8:50)**
  - **[9:35, 9:40)**
  - Etc.

Needless to say, there will be **no empty** windows! One of the rationales behind this design decision which is very reasonable is **SIMPLICITY**.

### Session Windows

In the case of **session windows**, event times drive the allocation of windows and their boundaries for the most part. But, **overlapping** windows get **merged** and the segregation between windows are determined by the configured **gap duration**.

## A Word On Testing

When it comes to automated testing of your Flink application, itâ€™s worth tackling it at least from two angles:

1. Have a modular design which allows you to isolate and structure your pure logic in small and composable components. Each of those components should have their dedicated unit tests to verify their behavior.
2. Then youâ€™d plug these components into Flink APIs (e.g. **ItemAggregator** into **aggregate** API). At this point, you should zoom out and also write tests which verify the behavior of your components integrated/plugged with/into Flink. The tests written in [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/Sam-Serpoosh/194068bd4e9fea9958bfae1cf618597b) belong to this category.

A **HUGE** thanks and a shout-out to [**Konstantin Knauf**](https://twitter.com/snntrable) who's a solution architect at [Ververica Data (Formerly Data Artisan)](https://twitter.com/VervericaData) and works on **Apache Flink**. He has been extremely helpful throughout this obsessive curiosity of mine and I cannot thank him enough.

After I banged my head against the wall for a while and couldn't get to the bottom of this, I posted [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57121018/flink-windows-boundaries-watermark-event-timestamp-processing-time) on **Stack Overflow** and pinged (most likely annoyed) folks on **Twitter**. Shortly afterwards, Konstantin responded to the question :)

He also took the time to review the first draft of this post which I really appreciate.

### What's Up With Allowed-Lateness Test

Every test laid out in the aforementioned **GitHub Gist** passes with the expected behavior. **Except** for the case of *Allowed Lateness Of 2 Minutes* which you can find [here](https://gist.github.com/Sam-Serpoosh/194068bd4e9fea9958bfae1cf618597b#file-tumblingeventtimewindowtest-java-L249-L372). One of the followings must be happening:

1. My understanding of Flink's behavior in **allowed lateness** situation is **flawed**?!
2. Something is missing in my test **setup** which prevents it from properly mimicking the production behavior?!

Please share your thoughts in comments :)
